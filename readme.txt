1) All of the program operations are contained in a.cpp
 - to run, format is './a filename.pgm x y'

2) For larger images, particularly CAS.pgm and twoBalls.pgm, the runtime lasts about a minute at most to complete.

3) Processed images will be exported to the same directory as the .exe file, utilizing structure filename_processed.pgm

Please email me for any issues running the program.
